# Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright who is looking to uncover trends in the **Kickstarter** dataset, which includes data on a wide list of crowdfunding projects with their respective fundraising information, such as variables for the amount a play was aiming to fundraise (goal) versus how much it actually did (pledged), a categorical variable determining the outcome of the play's fundraising campaign, launch dates, and deadlines. Louise was looking to fundraise for her play, *Fever*, and while she has come close to her fundraising goal in a short time frame, she would now like to know how other plays fared with regards to their launch dates and their fundraising goals. 
### Analysis and Challenges
#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
First, Louise would like to understand the trends behind how well plays did with regards to their launch date. In particular, Louise will be looking at the *theater* category in the dataset. For this, we created a *Years* column that extracts the year from the *Data Created Conversion* column, which converts time data from the *launched_at* column into readable and understandable dates. Then, we will create a Pivot Table that filters the **Kickstarter** dataset by the *Parent Category* and *Years* columns. This will allow Louise to look at theater play data by the year she would like to see. The rows of the Pivot Table will contain the *Date Created Conversion* column, and we will remove the automatically created *Quarters* option to visualize the data for every month of the year from January to December. The *outcomes* will be filtered on the columns of the Pivot Table by *successful*, *failed*, and *canceled* outcomes. <img width="330" alt="TheaterOutcomes_LaunchDate" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92702922/139589946-75310f4e-3cf0-4e82-82dc-7770f271f7d3.png">
